# YouTube Video Reloader

Are you running into a pesky issue where youtube video's are stating "This content isn't availalble, try again later." that can be cleared by simply refreshing the page a few times? Well this is a simple script to automatically reload the video until that error goes away.


## Installation Guide

Install it from the Chrome Extension Store

OR download and follow the instructions below

1. Open **Google Chrome**.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** (top left).
5. Select the folder containing these files.

## How it Works

The extension monitors the YouTube player and proactively detects if the "This content isn't available" error appears as the page content loads. If detected, it triggers an immediate page reload until the video is successfully available.
